In my opinion <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">github</a> is the best way to share code on the internet but it was not possible to use it in <a href="http://www.nitt.edu/home/" target="_blank">NITT</a> because of the geniuses that are our network administrators and their love for the beast that is sonicwall. This is bizarre when you think that most of the students of this prestigious engineering college would work with code on a regular basis, the only thing more bizarre would the count of students who don't know about source code management at all.

This is now no more of an issue as github has come up with <a href="https://github.com/blog/642-smart-http-support" target="_blank">smart HTTP support</a>. Now not only can all of us who are behind sonicwall can use it but anyone behind any firewall can, the other good part is that the transportation algorithm has been optimized so it uses lesser bandwidth. Do drop in a line if your institute also has a crazy firewall that blocks legitimate things.
