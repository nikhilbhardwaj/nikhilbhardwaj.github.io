I spend a lot of time in front of the terminal and have been using bash ever since I can remember, it&#8217;s a fine shell indeed but as I discovered recently, there is a better alternative available. I came across a github project that extends zsh and adds to it, tonnes of features including themes, plugins and configurations<!--more-->

I had customized my bash by the means of the **PS1** environment variable and set up some aliases to make the output of the commands like **ls** colored. Oh my zsh does all of this and more. A common mistake that I make is getting the case of some command wrong bash blows up in my face but this automatically corrects this for me. It also fixes minor spelling mistakes that I occasionally.

All in all this makes working with the terminal a lot more fun. I&#8217;d recommend it to beginners as well as seasoned users, there&#8217;s a bit in it for everyone. It will make the terminal a lot less intimidating for a newbie and be a productivity boost for others. In the end you&#8217;ll be left saying Oh my zhs!

Checkout the screenshot of my terminal showcasing some of its abilities
