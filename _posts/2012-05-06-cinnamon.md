After installing the 12.04 LTS version of ubuntu I was quite happy with the performance of the system, there was however one thing that bugs me. It's unity of course, if you like unity then don't bother reading further but if you don't like it then Cinnamon is for you.

It's quite easy to install it, all that is needed is that we add a ppa and then use apt-get to install.

<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate" title="">sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gwendal-lebihan-dev/cinnamon-stable
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install cinnamon

</pre>

After this you need to log out and choose cinnamon as the session. I love the fact that it is very simple and doesn't get in my way. It keeps the desktop the way it is meant to be for people like me. I'm critical of both Ubuntu and Microsoft for the radical change in the desktop, it's great for mobile devices but I personally like the desktop the way it has always been and by the looks of it, there are many others in the linux community who share this opinion and for those who don't there's always unity.
